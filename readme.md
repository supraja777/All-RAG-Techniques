# RAG Implementations

This repository serves as a **central hub for all my Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) experiments and implementations**.  
Each project explores a different technique, enhancement, or research direction within the RAG ecosystem — from advanced corrective and agentic pipelines to foundational baseline RAG systems.

## 📚 Project Index (Advanced → Beginner)

| # | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Agentic RAG**  
  → [github.com/supraja777/Agentic_RAG](https://github.com/supraja777/Agentic_RAG) | Agent-powered RAG system integrating planning, tool use, memory, and dynamic multi-step reasoning. |
| 2 | **Self-RAG**  
  → [github.com/supraja777/Self-RAG](https://github.com/supraja777/Self-RAG) | Self-refining RAG that evaluates its own retrieved context and iteratively improves responses. |
| 3 | **CRAG**  
  → [github.com/supraja777/CRAG](https://github.com/supraja777/CRAG) | Corrective RAG: performs retrieval + validation + filtering to ensure factual grounding and reduce noise. |
| 4 | **RAG-Reranking**  
  → [github.com/supraja777/RAG-Reranking](https://github.com/supraja777/RAG-Reranking) | Uses cross-encoder–based re-ranking to deliver higher-quality retrieval before generation. |
| 5 | **Hypothetical Document Embedding (HDE)**  
  → [github.com/supraja777/Hypothetical-Document-Embedding](https://github.com/supraja777/Hypothetical-Document-Embedding) | Uses synthetic “hypothetical” text embeddings to improve semantic search performance. |
| 6 | **Reliable-RAG**  
  → [github.com/supraja777/Reliable-RAG](https://github.com/supraja777/Reliable-RAG) | Focuses on stability and reliability by reducing hallucination and improving robustness. |
| 7 | **Simple-RAG**  
  → [github.com/supraja777/Simple-RAG](https://github.com/supraja777/Simple-RAG) | A clean and minimal baseline RAG implementation using standard retrieval + generation. |
